        <p>The Recovery Empowerment Networking and Employment for Women Foundation (RENEW), also known as Renew Foundation, is an 
          international Christian non-profit and non-government organization in the Philippines established in 2005, dedicated to empowering 
          female survivors of human trafficking and prostitution in the Philippines. I support the RENEW Foundation because it empowers female
          survivors of human trafficking by helping them heal, rebuild, and regain independence. Not only do they empower these victims, it is also their 
          goal to eradicate the human trafficking of women and children through advocacy, networking and education. Every victim deserves
          the opportunity for a brighter future, and Renew Foundation helps make that a reality.
